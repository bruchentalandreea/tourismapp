# Web application with tourism recommendation system
My final project consists in the development of a web application that offers the functionalities necessary for a user to choose a travel package and at the same time to facilitate their provision by the existing tourism companies. The software solution also aims to create a reliable, scalable, available recommendation engine that can offer personalized recommendations in real time for all the users it contains.
#### The proposed solution consists of a web application that meets the following requirements:
**Obtaining a software solution that will develop the necessary functionalities in order to reserve a tourist offer**
**Creation of an online recommendation system**
**Implementation of the system with the "k nearest neighbors" algorithm**
**Finding relevant suggestions based on other people's recommendations to meet the needs of the current user**
